# Deep Neural Network for MNIST Classification
- It is a deep learning algorithm that detects which digit is written in provided MNIST dataset and classify all into 10 classes i.e. 10 digits (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9).
- We built a neural network with 2 hidden layers.
- We built the model using "ADAM" optimeizer and "Softmax" as output activation function.
- The final test accuracy should be roughly around 97%.
- The dataset is called MNIST and refers to handwritten digit recognition.
- The dataset provides 70,000 images (28x28 pixels) of handwritten digits (1 digit per image). TensorFLow includes a data provider for MNIST that we'll use.
